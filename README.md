+ Project summary: 
	As the Affordable Care Act, so called ObamaCare, was signed into law in 2010, it is reported that there has been a high increase in a number of health insurance coverage. Especially, a bulk of its provisions, taxes, and programs rolled out in 2013 and 2014, and it was expected that a larger number of people would be enrolled for the care during the period. 
	
	Going forward, it is intriguing to look at what really happened, to what extent it brought impacts, and who were the driving force of this change between 2013 and 2014. From 2013 to 2014, there was a 3% increase in health insurance coverage, as the percentage of Americans who had health insurance coverage went from 87.1% to 90.0%, a marked increase year-over-year.
	
	We first analyzed only 2013 population data to see who had more or less health insurance, and to what extent they had. Then, we rolled it forward to the next year to see if there was any greater change in a certain group of people, if it looked reasonable, and eventually if ObamaCare brought impacts over the year.
